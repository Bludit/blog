# Title: Bludit v2.0 Beta 1
<!-- Date: 2017-08-12 22:00:00 -->
---
I would like to present the first beta version of the next generation of Bludit. This version of Bludit is **NOT** compatible with any previous Bludit version, because the database structure changed, I going to start working on the `exporter from v1.x to v2.x` but is going to be included in the next Beta version.

**DO NOT UPDATE YOUR CURRENT VERSION WITH THIS VERSION. ONLY FOR CLEAN INSTALLATIONS.**

**THIS VERSION IS A BETA VERSION AND INCLUDES A LOT OF BUGS! IF YOU FIND SOME BUG, PLEASE REPORT IT AND I GOING TO KILL THEM.**
