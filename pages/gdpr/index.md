# EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regultation)
<!-- Date: 2018-03-30 13:00:00 -->

We want like to communicate to the Bludit community about the `EU GDPR` a new law about the data protection and privacy of the users. We are working on it to provide to the user the best experience with Bludit and his privacy.

Bludit package and Bludit PRO package (the zip file you download from our servers) are 100% compliant with this new law.

[Edi](https://clickwork.ch) is working on the research and adding new information on his wiki.
