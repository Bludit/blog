After some feedback from the users (about some bugs) in the version 3.7.0, we decide to release the version 3.7.1 because we want to provide a good quality of software. Sorry for the inconvenience of re-updating in this short time.

Thanks to all the people who support Bludit, developers, designers, translators, a lot of new people in the community!
