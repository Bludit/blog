After the new release of Bludit v3.5.0, we would like to present the official Docker image. You can download the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bludit/docker/).

Run the container in your Docker server:
```
docker run --name bludit -p 8000:80 -d bludit/docker:3.5.0
```

Now you can get access with your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
